Functional Programming -
----------------------
It was only introduced in java 1.8,I this type
of programming functions are treated as values which means that we can assign
these function to a variable or can pass as parameter in other functions, also we can also
return function from another function.

Functional Interface-
---------------------
There are interface which has only one abstract method. We can achieve
functional programming with the help of functional interface.

String emp= “10,Manoj,80000”
1. Predicate<Employee> -

Demo.java
-------

public static void main(String[] args){
Predicate<Integr> s =s-> s>8000;
System.out.println
}
