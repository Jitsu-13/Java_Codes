Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a
Thread? with proper example.
Ans- Thread class and Runnable interface are the two structure using which we
implement Thread based multitasking in java.

We implement thread either of the following two ways-
1. By implementing Runnable interface
ex-
class A implements Runnable{
    public void run{
        // tasks
    }
}

2. By extending thread class
ex-
class A extends Thread{
    public void run(){
        // tasks
    }
}

Internally Thread class also implements Runnable interface and override run()
method with emty implementation.
