Q6) What if we call Java run() method directly instead start() method?
ex-
class A implements Runnable{
    public void run(){
        System.out.println("Inside run");
    }
}
_question7.Main-
-----

class _question7.Main{
    public static void main(Strings[] args){
        System.out.println("inside main");
        A a=new A();
        Thread tr =new Thread(a);
        tr.run();
        // If we dirctly do .run() then the process with be single threaded only
        because, in class A there is a run method , so it will present
        overriden method as it turn comes but not paralley.
        // Instead if we do .start() - It will make run method as a thread, so there
        we two thread one will be default main an other one is run. Once we have
        initialized the thread, the if we run run, ten it will run parallely.
    }
}
