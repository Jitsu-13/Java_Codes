Q3) Differentiate between process and thread based multitasking.
Ans- Multitasking is the process of executing multiple task simultaneously.
We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. We can acieve multitasking in two ways-
1. Process Based Multitasking-
--------------------------------
* Each process has an address in the memory, so each processes are allocated
different memory area.
* A process is heavyweight.
* The cost of communication between the process is high.
* Switching from one process to other requires some time for saving and loading register,
memory maps and loading registers.
2. Thread Based Multitasking-
-------------------------------
* Threads share the same memory space(a thread is a part of process)
* A thread is lightweight
* The cost of communication between threads is low.
