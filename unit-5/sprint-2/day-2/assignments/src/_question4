Q4/ What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?
Ans- If very few lines of code require synchronization , then it is not
recommended to declare entire method as synchronized.Then we have to enclose those few lines of the
code in synchronized block.

The main advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method is, it reduces the
waiting time of the threads and improve the performance of the application.
