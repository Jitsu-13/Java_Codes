Sleep and Join methods both are static methods of suspending the thread.If
we want to suspend the thread based on time then we use sleep()
eg-  Thread.sleep(1000)- this method will suspend the current thread which is
under execution with those many millisecond passed as argument (1000ms -1s);

ex =
class Main extends Thead{
    public void run(){
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            System.out.println("Inside run" +i);
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main job = new Main();
        job.start();
        System.out.println("end of main()...");
    }

}
