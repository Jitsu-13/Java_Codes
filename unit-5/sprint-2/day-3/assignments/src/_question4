Q4/- What is the difference between the synchronized block and the synchronized
method? Write down the different syntaxes of the synchronized block with examples.
Ans- If very few lines of the code requires synchronization then it is not recommended to declare entire method as
     synchronized. we have to enclose those few lines of the code in synchronized block.
    The main advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method is ,it reduces the waiting time of the threads
    and improves the performance of the application.

    1. synchronized block to get a object level lock of the same class:
    Example
    void fun1(){
    System.out.println("do something...");
    //1 thousand lines of codes are there
    synchronized(this){--//here if a thread gets the lock of current obj then it is allowed to execute
    //this block
    System.out.println("do some more thing1");
    }
    //1 thousand lines of codes r there
    }

    2. synchronized block to get a object level lock of different object
    Example:
    A a1=new A();
    A a2=new A();
    void fun1(){
    System.out.println("do something...");
    synchronized(a1){//if a thread gets the lock of a1 object of A class
    //(not a2 obj of A class) then only it is allowed
    //to execute the following block of code
    System.out.println("do some more thing1");
    System.out.println("do some more thing2");
    }

    3. To get a class level lock:
    Example
    synchronized(A.class){//if a thread gets the class level lock of class A
    //then only it is allowed to execute following block
    System.out.println("do some more thing1");
    }
