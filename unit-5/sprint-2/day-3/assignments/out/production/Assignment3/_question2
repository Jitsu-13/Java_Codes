Q2/ What is the Difference between the wait and sleep methods?

sleep -
-----------
Suspending a thread based on time:There is a static method by name
sleep(long ms) inside the Thread class which takes time in milliseconds as an argument
ex -
Thread.sleep(1000);
This method will suspend the current thread which is under execution with those many millisecond passed as
argument(1000ms=1sec).

wait-
----------
Two synchronized thread can communicate each other by using some methods present in Object class, those
methods are wait(), notify(), notifyAll().
Whenever we need to suspend a synchronized thread unconditionally then we use wait() method.
